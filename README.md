# P3D EFB Broadcast

This tool uses data provided from SimConnect to broadcast to EFB's like Garmin Pilot and ForeFlight using the same protocol that X-Plane uses.

Currently has only been tested on the following platform:
- Prepar3d v3
- Windows 10
- Garmin Pilot on Android

Garmin Pilot doesn't pick up traffic information from this method from what I can tell, so it'd be great to have some testers on other platforms!
